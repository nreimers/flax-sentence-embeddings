# Demo for jax-sentence-transformers


---

Please find the models in the hub of  HuggingFace: [flax-sentence-embeddings](https://huggingface.co/flax-sentence-embeddings).

The models were created for the JAX community event.

This demo illustrates the models created using Jax and HuggingFace. Specifically, we will make semantic search between texts. For more on this refer to the [sbert project](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html).


# Running the demo

---

We will use FastApi in the backend and Streamlit in the frontend.

[more details soon]
